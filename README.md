# Airbnb Data Visualization using Tableau Project

## Overview

This project is a Tableau dashboard that leverages the 2016 Airbnb dataset to provide insightful visualizations. The dashboard displays key metrics and trends related to Airbnb listings, including average price by bedroom, price per zipcode (with both a map and bar chart representation), and yearly revenue. Additionally, it includes a table showing the distinct count of bedroom listings across various categories.

## Features

The dashboard includes the following visualizations and metrics:

1. **Average Price per Bedroom**  
   Displays the average price of Airbnb listings segmented by the number of bedrooms.

2. **Price by Zipcode**  
   - A map visualizing Airbnb pricing distribution across various zipcodes.  
   - A bar chart displaying the average price per zipcode for easy comparison.

3. **Revenue for the Year**  
   A chart showing the total revenue generated by Airbnb listings for the year.

4. **Distinct Count of Bedroom Listings**  
   A table that displays the distinct count of listings based on the number of bedrooms, offering a deeper understanding of listing distribution.

## Data Source

The project uses the 2016 Airbnb dataset, which contains details about listings, pricing, geographic location, and other relevant attributes. The dataset was sourced from publicly available data (Kaggle or similar datasets).

## Installation

This project is hosted on Tableau Public, so you can explore the dashboard directly from the link provided above. No local setup or installation is required.

## How to Use the Dashboard

1. **Explore the Maps and Charts**:  
   Use the interactive features in Tableau to explore the maps and bar charts. Hover over specific areas for detailed information about pricing, zipcodes, and revenue.

2. **Filter by Bedroom Count**:  
   You can filter and compare the listings by the number of bedrooms to see how prices vary with different property types.

3. **View Revenue Over Time**:  
   Track Airbnb revenue trends over the course of the year with the dynamic revenue chart.

4. **Examine the Data Table**:  
   The distinct count of bedroom listings provides a comprehensive overview of the data distribution.

## Technologies Used

- **Tableau**: For creating the data visualizations and dashboard.
- **Airbnb 2016 Dataset**: Contains information about Airbnb listings, prices, locations, and other relevant metrics.

## Future Improvements

- Integrating more granular date-based analysis (monthly, quarterly).
- Adding filters for property type, room type, and other attributes.
- Enhancing map functionality to allow more interaction with the geographic data.
